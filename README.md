## Description

Div (also spelled Daeva, Dīv, or Dēw) are malevolent supernatural entities in Persian mythology, representing demons, evil spirits, and forces of chaos and destruction. Originating in ancient Zoroastrian cosmology where they were deities who became demons in opposition to Ahura Mazda, the div evolved through Persian history to become prominent figures in Islamic Persian folklore, literature, and art.

In Zoroastrian tradition, divs (daevas) were originally Indo-Iranian deities who were recast as demonic entities opposing the forces of good (ahuras). They embody lie, chaos, destruction, and moral corruption, serving Angra Mainyu (Ahriman), the principle of evil. In post-Islamic Persian culture, divs maintained their demonic nature while being integrated into Islamic cosmology alongside jinn and shaitan, becoming particularly prominent in Persian epic poetry like the Shahnameh.

Divs are typically depicted as monstrous, powerful beings with superhuman strength, magical abilities, and often grotesque physical features. They inhabit remote wilderness areas, ruins, and desolate places, emerging to battle heroes, kidnap humans, spread disease, and cause havoc. The struggle against divs represents the eternal battle between good and evil, civilization and chaos, divine order and demonic disruption.

## Conclusion

Div/daevas represent one of the oldest and most culturally significant demon traditions in human history, spanning from ancient Indo-Iranian religion through Zoroastrian cosmology to Islamic Persian literature and modern Iranian cultural heritage. These powerful demonic entities embody the principle of evil, chaos, and moral corruption in eternal opposition to divine order and goodness.

The transformation of daevas from deities in early Indo-Iranian religion to demons in Zoroastrian thought marks a pivotal moment in religious history, establishing a dualistic framework that influenced later religious traditions. In Persian epic poetry, particularly the Shahnameh, divs became iconic opponents for heroic protagonists, creating some of world literature's most memorable battle narratives.

Today, divs remain important elements of Iranian cultural identity and pride in ancient Persian civilization. They continue to feature in art, literature, and popular culture while serving as powerful symbols for the eternal struggle between good and evil. Whether understood as literal supernatural beings, psychological projections, or literary devices, divs maintain their significance as profound expressions of human understanding of morality, heroism, and the nature of evil.
